Since the arrival of the internet and affordable access to technologies, digital technologies have occupied a growing place in industries, propelling us towards a 4th industrial revolution: Industry 4.0. In today's era of digital upheaval, enterprises are increasingly undergoing transformations that are leading to their digitalization. The traditional manufacturing industry is in the throes of a digital transformation that is accelerated by exponentially growing technologies (e.g., intelligent robots, Internet of Things, sensors, 3D printing). Around the world, enterprises are in a frantic race to implement solutions based on IoT to improve their productivity, innovation, and reduce costs and improve their markets on the international scene.Â  Considering the immense transformative potential that IoTs and big data have to bring to the industrial sector, the adoption of IoT in all industrial systems is a challenge to remain competitive and thus transform the industry into a smart factory. This paper presents the description of the innovation and digitalization process, following the Industry 4.0 paradigm to implement a successful enterprise IoT strategy.
