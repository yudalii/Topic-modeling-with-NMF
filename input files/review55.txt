Cybercrime and threats of cyber security is much closer to connected home ecosystems futures that ever been expected. Most of the research effort is focused on the defense mechanisms of cooperate and national infrastructures, not realizing that one of the weakest link in this systems comes from the devices used within connected smart homes of now and the future. The paper forms part of the research to analyze implications and challenges of cybersecurity to smart devices in smart connected homes. We present some related background and motivation seen on the development and demand for seamless interconnectivity of smart devices to provide various functionality and abilities to users. The paper highlights the fact that while these devices provide more features and functionality, they also introduce new risks. Subsequently, current cybersecurity issues related to smart devices within connected homes discussed and analyzed.
