There are some intriguing parallels between the modern development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those utilising ‘deep learning’ methods, and the development of nuclear arsenals and strategy by the Cold War superpowers. Nuclear weapons were retrospectively described as an ‘offset’ strategy, a way of compensating for relative disadvantages in conventional weaponry, notably by the US against the USSR. Now, AI is heralded in the US as a ‘third offset’, following the 1970s development of information technologies as a ‘second offset’ strategy. The analogy clearly appeals to some in the Pentagon. The comparison is meaningful insofar as both technologies offer new military capabilities that have the potential to transform strategy and to dramatically affect the balance of power. The strategic-studies literature on AI is sparse, which is one important reason to consider salient parallels. But there are some important differences between AI and nuclear weapons, which themselves are illuminating about the future of AI in warfare. In particular, nuclear weapons were arguably less revolutionary than AI, in that they did not alter the psychological essence of strategic affairs. In any case, making the comparison yields some useful strategic insights about AI while avoiding the hyperbole that often distorts the issue.
