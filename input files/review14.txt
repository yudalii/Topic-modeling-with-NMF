In the past decade, current literature and businesses have drawn attention to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and in particular to the advances in machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, while the AI technology offers great potential to solve difficulties, challenges remain implicated in practical implementation and lack of expertise in the strategic usage of AI to create business value. This paper aims to implement a systematic literature review analyzing convergence of the AI and corporate strategy and develop a theoretical model incorporating issues based on the existing research in this field. Eighty-one peer-reviewed articles were discussed on the basis of research methodology from Webster and Watson (2002). In addition to gaps in future research, a theoretical model is developed, discussing the four sources of value creation: AI and Machine Learning in organizations; alignment of AI tools and Information Technology (IT) with organizational strategy; AI, knowledge management and decision-making process; and AI, service innovation and value. These outcomes lead to both theoretical and managerial viewpoints, with extensive possibilities to generate new methods and types of management practices.
