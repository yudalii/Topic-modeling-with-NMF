The digital transformation is of increasing relevance for insurance companies’ business models. It leads to opportunities as well as challenges, especially for IT departments as core enablers or preventers. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, cloud computing) and the resulting use cases for the insurance industry. To this end, we conduct a review of academic articles, industry studies and publications of the supervisory authorities. We point to the resulting requirements for an insurer’s IT and find many interdependencies between the digital technologies. Our results therefore emphasize the importance of a holistic digital strategy.
